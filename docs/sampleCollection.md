# Collection overview

The collection guidelines applied here are derived from the Human Microbiome Project standards - see [HMP MOP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/GetPdf.cgi?id=phd003190.2) for full guidelines.	

Please be particularly cautions of the following:  

- **Consistency of collection technique**: each subject should have samples collected in as similar a fashion as possible. Stick to the guidelines established below.  
- **Sterility**: even if samples are acquired in identical fashion, non-sterile techniques will lead to contaminated samples. Be sure to follow sterile practices (discussed below)  

# Collection materials and storage

Collection materials consist of 2 components:
1. Sterile swabs
2. Collection tubes

In addition, I have provided:
- ethanol wipes
- razors

I have not provided nitrile/latex gloves. It is my assumption you can obtain those at Berkshire.  

Immediately after swabbing, each applicator must be placed in 2 mL of sterile 1X PBS pH 7.4 buffer in the 15 mL Flacon tube. Because the applicator shaft is longer than the tube is long, a portion of the shaft will must be cut to fit the screw cap back on. Swab a razor with the ethanol wipe, then cut the shaft at about half it's length. Ensure the swab tip side is submerged in the PBS buffer.  

Place tubes in refridgerator at 4C until shipment. Ship using cool packs (cold, not frozen).	

# Collection practices
## Sterile techinque
- Prior to handling any collection materials, wash hands. 
- Avoid transferring collection materials in an open environment; keep sealed in a container when transporting.
- Avoid open-air environments when collecting swabs (ie. perform collections indoors when possible). Best practices would ensure that all collections occur in the same room to reduce variability of airborne contaminants (if possible).
- Change gloves between sample collections. 

## Sample collection steps:
- Prior to sample collection, put on gloves. Use an ethanol wipe and apply to both gloves; allow to air dry briefly.
- Loosen screw cap tube; do not remove tube (leave lid closed so air can not enter).
- Open sterile Fisherbrand Polyester-Tipped 6 Inch Sterile Applicator and apply swab to subject (see options below).
- Place swab side of applicator in 15 mL Falcon tube with 1X PBS pH 7.4; submerge swab into PBS media for 30 seconds
- Obtain razor and wipe with ethanol; allow to air dry
- Gently pull up on swab shaft until half of shaft is out of tube and cut with razor
- Ensure swab is again submerged in PBS, screw cap on tightly, and place in rack
- Record all necessary data in [collection sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VQk03MeCEZeoWueudwHi6LyuHL9PosZPsOt5QF51PCM/edit#gid=1605844202). 

## Sampling techniques
It's unclear which place will work best when sampling from dogs. Having never done this, you'll probably have to figure out in real time which is best. Note that you _do not have to sample the same place on every dog!_. However, you do need to best apply the same technique when sampling from different dogs when obtaining samples from the same location (ie. make sure that whenever you are sampling from a similar area, be consistent in how long you apply the swab for and where you apply the swab).  
I think there are four potential sites which might work for this study. Choose one of the following areas (whichever works best for the subject):  
- Tongue: swab 1cm2 of the center of the tongue for 5 seconds
- Hard palate: Swab the entire hard palate for 10 seconds
- Cheeks: Swab the entire area of both left and right cheeks for 10 seconds each. Take care not to touch the teeth.
- Gums: Swab the gums above the upper teeth for 10 seconds.
