# PoreVita 2018 - Tiny Samples, Big Science

Swing over to the [Course Wiki](https://github.com/devonorourke/PoreVita/wiki) for details regarding curriculum, data, and student commentary. 

This course is part of a week-long workshop held at [Berkshire School](https://www.berkshireschool.org/), a private high school in Sheffield, Massachusetts. The workshop is part of their annual [ProVita](https://www.berkshireschool.org/academics/pro-vita) winter session which provides students a 1-week immersion in just a pair of classes they select. I've been interested in incorporating modern sequencing technologies - principally in [Oxford Nanopore's](https://nanoporetech.com/) portable MinION platform - in an educations setting. As a former teacher and student at the school this was a great opportunity to head back to the mountain, do some real science with the students, and try to discern what barriers reside in putting this kind of technology (and these kinds of projects) in any high school classroom. 

This was the course description: "_Interested in the microbes on you or in your environment? Want to do the actual science to discover what kind of microbes are there? Get on your goggles, pick up your pipettes, and lets start swabbing. No science prerequisites whatsoever - but the tools and topics covered will benefit anyone interested in doing future research at Berkshire or beyond._"
